## Project Overview
This repository contains the analysis and code for the Game Analytics Bootcamp Project, focusing on calculating key metrics and uncovering insights within gaming data. The project includes retention calculations, revenue analysis, player behavior predictions, and anomaly detection, providing a comprehensive view of player engagement and monetization.

## Key Objectives and Analyses

### Part 1: Key Performance Metrics
* Day 14 LTV Calculation
Objective: Calculate and interpret the Lifetime Value (LTV) on Day 14.

* Interstitial Ad Revenue Ratio
Objective: Determine the proportion of daily revenue derived from interstitial ads and analyze variations in this metric.

### Part 2: Retention and Revenue Projections
* Breakeven Point Analysis
Objective: Calculate the ARPDAU (Average Revenue Per Daily Active User) required to reach a breakeven point by Day 50, assuming a $10 CPI.

* ARPDAU Stability
Objective: Discuss assumptions behind a fixed ARPDAU and propose factors that might affect its accuracy.

### Part 3: Advanced Player Analysis
* Cheater Detection
Objective: Identify abnormal player stats indicative of cheating using statistical thresholds on character health and attack values.

* Gem and Gold Analysis
Objective: Evaluate the most efficient methods for players to earn in-game currency and investigate potential trends tied to retention.

### Part 4: Behavioral Insights
* Player Progression Insights
Objective: Assess the likely progression stage for Day 5 players and the stages for players attempting their 15th game attempt.

* Custom Analysis
Objective: Explore the relationship between player activity duration and gem/gold accumulation.

## Queries and Code
The project includes detailed SQL queries for various analyses, such as detecting cheaters, calculating cumulative player progression, and assessing retention rates. See SQL Scripts for the full query list and explanations.

## Recommendations
* Further Analysis on Player Retention:
Conduct deeper segmentation analysis to identify specific cohorts or behaviors that drive player retention beyond Day 14.

* Optimization of Ad Placement:
Based on the interstitial ad revenue ratio, explore ways to optimize ad placements, potentially improving monetization without compromising user experience.

* Event-Driven Currency Strategies:
Leverage data on high-yield gem sources, like login bonuses and quests, to design targeted strategies for player engagement and monetization.

## Getting Started
